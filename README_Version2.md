## 📖 My Story: Why I Built This

Hi! I'm a student just like you. 

Like many students, I'm part of **multiple WhatsApp groups and communities** for my courses - some have 100+ members, others are small study groups. Every day, professors and classmates post important information:

- 📅 "Midterm exam next Tuesday at 9 AM in Hall B"
- 📝 "Assignment due Friday, don't forget!"
- 📍 "Lecture room changed to Lab 301"
- 🔔 "Quiz tomorrow covers chapters 5-7"

But here's the problem: **These messages get buried** in hundreds of other conversations about homework help, group projects, and casual chat. I kept missing important announcements, forgetting exam dates, and scrambling to find information in old messages.

### 💡 The Solution

I wanted a system that would:

1. **Automatically read** my academic WhatsApp groups (without disrupting them)
2. **Filter and categorize** messages to find only the important stuff
3. **Extract key information** like exam dates, locations, times, and topics
4. **Create a beautiful calendar** showing everything at a glance
5. **Send me smart reminders** so I never miss anything important
6. **Work with multiple WhatsApp accounts** (I have personal and university accounts)

And most importantly: **I wanted it to be FREE and easy to use** for fellow students!

## 🌟 What Does This Do? (Simple Explanation)

Think of this as your **personal academic assistant** that:

### ✅ Watches Your WhatsApp Groups 24/7
- Monitors your academic groups and communities
- Doesn't send any messages or disturb anyone
- Works silently in the background

### 🧠 Understands What's Important
- Uses AI to read messages and find exam dates, assignments, and deadlines
- Knows the difference between "Exam tomorrow!" and "Anyone want to grab lunch?"
- Understands corrections like "Wait, the exam is Friday, not Thursday!"

### 📅 Creates Your Academic Calendar
- Beautiful web dashboard showing all your upcoming events
- Color-coded by priority (red for urgent exams, yellow for assignments, etc.)
- Shows location, time, topics to study, and more

### 🔔 Reminds You at the Right Time
- Smart notifications before important events
- Multiple reminders for critical exams (24h, 6h, 3h, 1h before)
- Quiet hours support (no alerts while you're sleeping!)

### 🎛️ Gives You Full Control
- Professional admin dashboard to manage everything
- Filter which groups to monitor
- Control how the AI works
- Customize notification settings
- Handle images, documents, audio messages, and more

## 🎨 Priority System Explained

The system automatically assigns colors to events based on urgency:

| Color | When Used | Example | Notifications |
|-------|-----------|---------|---------------|
| 🔴 **CRITICAL** | Exams <24h away | "Final exam tomorrow!" | 4 reminders |
| 🟠 **HIGH** | Major deadlines 2-7 days | "Project due Friday" | 3 reminders |
| 🟡 **MEDIUM** | Regular assignments | "Homework due next week" | 2 reminders |
| 🟢 **LOW** | General info | "Office hours changed" | 1 reminder |
| 🔵 **INFO** | Announcements | "Guest lecture next month" | Email digest |
| 🟣 **OPTIONAL** | Extra credit | "Bonus assignment available" | No alerts |

**You can customize these!** The dashboard lets you adjust what counts as "critical" vs "medium".

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: QR Code Won't Scan

**Problem:** QR code appears but WhatsApp says "invalid"

**Solutions:**
1. Refresh the page and try again
2. Make sure your phone and computer are on the same network
3. Check if WhatsApp Web works normally (web.whatsapp.com)
4. Try unlinking other devices first (WhatsApp allows max 4 linked devices)

---

### Issue 2: No Messages Being Detected

**Problem:** Groups are monitored but dashboard shows nothing

**Solutions:**
1. Check the `/messages` page - messages might be processed but not categorized as events
2. Verify AI provider is working:
   - Go to `/ai` → Click "Test Provider"
   - Should return a response
3. Check filter rules - you might have too strict filters
4. Send a very obvious test message:
   ```
   "URGENT: Test exam tomorrow at 10 AM in Room 101"
   ```

---

### Issue 3: Database Connection Errors

**Problem:** Error: "Cannot connect to database"

**Solutions:**
1. Double-check your `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`
2. Make sure you replaced `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with actual password
3. Test connection:
   ```bash
   python backend/test_connection.py
   ```
4. If using Supabase, check if project is still running (not paused)

---

### Issue 4: API Key Errors

**Problem:** Error: "Invalid API key" or "Quota exceeded"

**Solutions:**
1. Verify your API key is correct:
   - Go to the service (e.g., Gemini) and regenerate key
   - Update `.env` file
   - Restart the backend
2. Check quota limits:
   - Gemini: 1,500/day - try tomorrow if exceeded
   - Switch to another AI provider temporarily
3. Use local Ollama as backup (no API key needed!)

---

### Issue 5: Notifications Not Working

**Problem:** Not receiving alerts

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser permissions (allow notifications)
2. Verify notification channel is enabled in `/notifications`
3. Check quiet hours settings
4. For email: verify SMTP settings in `.env`
5. Test with a critical event (should trigger immediate notification)

## 🎓 Use Cases - Real Student Stories

### 👨‍🎓 Ahmed - Computer Science Student
> "I'm in 8 WhatsApp groups for different courses. Professors post assignment deadlines randomly throughout the day. I used to screenshot important messages and set manual reminders. Now this system does it automatically - I haven't missed a deadline in 2 months!"

### 👩‍🎓 Sarah - Medical Student
> "Our anatomy professor sends voice messages with exam details. Before, I had to listen to each one carefully and write notes. Now the system transcribes them and extracts the exam date automatically. Saved me hours!"

### 👨‍🎓 Carlos - Engineering Student
> "Group projects are chaotic - 5 people coordinating across 3 WhatsApp groups. This system shows me all meeting times, deadlines, and who's responsible for what. My group actually stays organized now!"

### 👩‍🎓 Priya - Exchange Student
> "As an international student, I struggle with different date formats (DD/MM vs MM/DD) and time zones. The AI understands both and converts everything to my timezone. No more confusion!"
